        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Writing</b> - My number one hobby is also a form of part-time job. 
                I enjoy writing stories and releasing them as novels which then earn me a little money.
            Whether other people also enjoy them is another matter.</li>
            <li><b>Gym</b> - I'm extremely physically active, lifting and running four times a week, always pushing myself in an effort to stay young.</li>
            <li><b>Motorcycles</b> - One of my big passions in life is motorcycles. I've owned 13 bikes to date, and only fallen off a couple of them.</li>
            <li><b>Pipe Smoking</b> - Not many people smoke traditional pipes these days. I, however, am one of them, and a member of several pipe-smoking clubs. Fun fact, I once came 8th in the British Pipe Smoking Championships. Yes, there is such a thing.</li>
            <li><b>Whiskey</b> - does drinking single-malt whiskey count as a hobby? If not, it should.</li>
